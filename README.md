### **SUMMARY Three major advice:**

**1. Be persistent.**

Make an actionable study plan, schedule it out ahead of time, execute your plan ruthlessly, no excuses for procrastination or delay, if you missed one day, please make it up by the end of the week. Remember, the interview date is set and fast approaching.

**2. Time box each problem.**
Don't get stuck on one problem for over two hours, even 30 mins is good enough, then start browsing on Discuss board, you'll be inspired by the super lively community there.

**3. Take easy first**.

ðŸ’¡ sometimes I solve the solution using a very good approach and some months after I forget the approach.
It will be nice if you can share your thoughts on how to revise the pattern. What strategies we should use.

â€”-
Good question! I totally echo with you on this, it's called Forgetting Curve:

That's why people tend to focus their effort/time/energy in the last few months/weeks right before their interviews so that they have the best/fresh memory possible.
But some of the core algorithms and data structures that we get to learn from cracking these LeetCode problems are absolutely precious, with day to day practical use in your future software engineering job, for those, I'd say: Keep repeating, until they become your second nature or muscle memory
